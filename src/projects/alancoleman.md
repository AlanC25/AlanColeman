<!-- excerpt start -->

I originally built this website as a way to showcase my previous projects and experience convienently. I also wanted to use it as a chance to refresh my javascript, responsive html, and css skills.

<!-- excerpt end -->

It has since evolved into a playground that I'm using as a way to play with new technologies that I come across such as `Eleventy` and `Greensock`.

## The problem

To share many of my projects, I often had to share links to site's such as itch.io, were I have hosted builds, and to sites such as GitHub, were I have made code and other elements visible to those who want a closer look. This was not ideal, as many potential employers want to see multiple projects.

## The solution

This website allows me the oppourtunity to share my recent projects to interested parties with just 1 link. It allows any potential employers/clients to learn what I can do for them, along with seeing the quality of my work. 

## The outcome

#### What I've learned (so far):
