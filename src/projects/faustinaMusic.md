<!-- excerpt start -->

I built and hosted this website for Faustina O'Sullivan. She needed a website so that she could showcase her skills as a musician and teacher.

<!-- excerpt end -->

## The problem

While putting herself forward for advertised gigs, such as weddings and other ceremonies, Faustina was becoming frustrated at having other musicians getting in first while she searched for her SoundCloud and Social Media links. 

## The solution

This website gives Faustina the oppourtunity to share everything she needs with interested parties, with just 1, easy to remember link.

## The outcome

Using Bootstrap for this site, made it possible for any device to view in a simple, yet stylish manner.

| [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) | I have had experience with Bootstrap previously this was a good oppourtunity to explore it more |

| [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)            | Again, something that I've had experience with previously, but got a lot more comfortable with |
