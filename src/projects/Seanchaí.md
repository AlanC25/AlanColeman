<!-- excerpt start -->

This video game was created as my final project, as part of a Master's in Creative Digital Media & UX, at Technological University Dublin.

## The problem

While in the planning stages of this project. I was unsure what I should make a game about. By chance, I went to Wild Lights at Dublin City Zoo, where the years theme was based on Stories and Literature. After admiring the light of well known stories such as Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland, we came across a section based on Irish Myths and Legends. Suddenly, I was remembering all of these great tales I had heard as a child, but had ultimately forgotten about. It dawned on me, that these stories were forgotten by many people in Ireland as they're not as accessible as stories used in film and tv. (fairytales used by Disney for example)

## The solution

I decided that the lack of accessibility for these stories could be my gain, and began working on Seanchaí. Seanchaí is Irish for storyteller and involves collecting and learning about ancient items. The player must also play through 3 classic tales of Irish folklore.

## The outcome

The game was completed to a high standard and while I am still waiting on receiving a result, it has received very positive feedback.
