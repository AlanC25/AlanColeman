<!-- excerpt start -->

A game developed in Unity to demonstrate an understanding of Game Programming. C# skills and procedural generation were key in this project. 

<!-- excerpt end -->

## The problem

My final assignment in a Game Programming module. We had to create a game that demonstrated an understanding of C# scripting and procedural generation.

## The solution

I took this assignment as an oppourtunity to improve on my understanding of procedural generation, and C# skills. I decided to make a 3D, space invaders inspired game. Using procedural generation, I was able to create a city with randomised buildings, along with city walls and weapons places along the perimeter.

## The outcome

This game received a high grade. Working on this project greatly improved my understanding of procedural generation, as I experimented with different options and possibilites. It also helped to cement my fundamental C# scripting skills.
