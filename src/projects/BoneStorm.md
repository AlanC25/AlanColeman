<!-- excerpt start -->

A game developed in Unity to demonstrate an understanding of Game Systems.

<!-- excerpt end -->

## The problem

My final assignment in a Game Systems module. We had to create a game that demonstrated an understanding of Game Systems.

## The solution

I took this assignment as an oppourtunity to brush up on some core Unity skills. I decided to make a 3D arcade-inspired 3rd person survival shooter. This allowed me to play around with player scripts, enemy AI, items, and NPC's to interact with.

## The outcome

The game received a high grade. It also greatly improved my C# scripting skills as I scripted my own 3rd person 'Player' scripts, rather than relying on scripts available through Unity's standard assets.
