<!-- excerpt start -->

Learning Blocks is a project created to demonstrate knowledge of Augmented Reality applications, using Unity Game Engine and Vuforia.

## The Problem

During my time at Technological University Dublin, I studied a module in Augmented and Virtual Reality. For our main assignment, we were tasked with Creating an application that demonstrates understanding and knowledge of the technologies used.

## The Solution

The idea was simple, an AR application created in Unity & Vuforia, that would generate a sum while pointed at the companion poster. This sum could then be answered by the user, by pointing the camera at the correct Number Block!   

## The outcome

I am very proud of the end result of this app, which received a high grade and much praise. I am currently working on a new version of the app that would use real Blocks in place of a poster. This would allow for more complex sums and a larger range for answers!
