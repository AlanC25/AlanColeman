        <!-- excerpt start -->
<p>Shortly after joining MyHome.ie it was announced that we would be beginning work on a frontend rewrite.</p>
<!-- excerpt end -->
<p>This was an exciting time and an incredible chance to learn as we would be writing our own code instead of maintaing someone elses as was the case with the old frontend.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>The reason for the move to a new frontend was that the old frontend(v6) was bloated. It contained lots of code that was either no longer used, or was repetitive instead of reused. There was also huge room for improvement in responsiveness and performance. We also belive the look of the website needed a facelift and could design a new one that was much more modern looking and inviting to users.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>Creating a new frontend from scratch allowed us to set better standards. We focussed on making code reusable and making every component with Bootstrap, reducing the HTML, TypeScript and CSS required, and making pages more responsive to different screen sizes.</p>
<h2>The outcome</h2>
<p>The outcome was incredible. At first we worked on the new frontend while also maintaining the old frontend, but the more we worked on it, the more it became MyHome's priority. We launched the new frontend in March 2023. The business side were thrilled with the outcome as it is a much more attractive frontend that is several times quicker and more responsive. By every metric on Page Speed Insights, it significantly outperforms the old frontend, and in many surpassed the requirements we set.</p>
<p>The current website can be seen here: https://www.myhome.ie/ A snapshot of the old frontend can be seen here for comparison: https://web.archive.org/web/20230222074945/https://www.myhome.ie/</p>
<p>On a personal note, it was an incredible learning experience for me. I had not used Angular professionally before this, yet despite only spending one year with it, I feel I am firmly an intermediate-advanced level thanks to my involvement in creating something new rather than maintaining something that came before.</p>
